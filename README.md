# Convolutional-Neural-Network-From-Scratch

We implemented a fully connected deep learning network in Python from scratch. In addition to implementing key functionalities like forward propagation, backward propogation, and a cost function, we implemented various regularizers (L1, L2, dropout) and optimizers (SGD with momentum, RMS prop, Adam).  

We trained the network on the CIFAR10 dataset and ensured greater than 50% accuracy on a validation set to ensure proper functioning of the neural network.
