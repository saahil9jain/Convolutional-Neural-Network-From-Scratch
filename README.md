# Convolutional-Neural-Network-From-Scratch

We implemented a fully connected deep learning network in Python from scratch. In addition to implementing key functionalities like forward and backward propagation, we implemented various regularizers (L1, L2, dropout) and optimizers (SGD with momentum, RMS prop, Adam).  

We trained the network on the CIFAR10 dataset and achieved greater than 50% accuracy on a validation set to ensure proper functioning of the neural network.
